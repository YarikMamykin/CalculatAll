CalculatAll is a web application designed to combine multiple calculation methods in one place.

Over time of my career I experienced troubles and inconvenience in calculating e.g. timestamps, primitive numbers, convertion of values and others which led me to search all over the internet for specific site. 

Often calculations would be something like:
- Get difference between timestamps
- Convert difference to seconds/minutes/hours
- Add some offset specified in seconds 

So I came up with idea to build a free tool which would have idea of widgets gathered in one place and satisfying clients with all possible calculation types provided.
